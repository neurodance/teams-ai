# Migrating from Teams AI v1

Welcome, fellow agent developer! You've made it through a full major release of Teams AI, and now you want to take the plunge into v2. In this guide, we'll walk you through everything you need to know, from migrating core features like message handlers and auth, to optional AI features like `ActionPlanner`. <LanguageInclude section="botbuilder-adapter-note" />

## Installing Teams AI v2

<LanguageInclude section="installation" />

## Migrate Application class

First, migrate your `Application` class from v1 to the new `App` class.

<LanguageInclude section="app-migration" />

## Migrate activity handlers

Both Teams AI v1 and v2 are built atop incoming `Activity` requests, which trigger handlers in your code when specific type of activities are received. The syntax for how you register different types of `Activity` handlers differs <LanguageInclude section="activity-handlers-intro" /> between the v1 and v2 versions of our SDK.

### Message handlers

<LanguageInclude section="message-handlers" />

### Task modules

<LanguageInclude section="task-modules-note" />

<LanguageInclude section="task-modules" />

Learn more in the [Dialogs guide](../in-depth-guides/dialogs).

## Adaptive cards

In Teams AI v2, cards have much more rich type validation than existed in v1. However, assuming your cards were valid, it should be easy to migrate to v2.

<LanguageInclude section="adaptive-cards" />

Learn more in the [Adaptive Cards guide](../in-depth-guides/adaptive-cards).

## Authentication

Most agents feature authentication for user identification, interacting with APIs, etc. Whether your Teams AI v1 app used Entra SSO or custom OAuth, porting to v2 should be simple.

<LanguageInclude section="authentication" />

## AI

### Feedback

If you supported feedback for AI generated messages, migrating is simple.

You can learn more about feedback in Teams AI v2 in the [Feedback guide](../in-depth-guides/feedback).
