# Deployment Guide

We cover the most common setup and deployment steps for testing in teams, including configuration instructions, and references for handling potential issues during deployment.

## User Assigned Managed Identity

This section demonstrates how to configure authentication in your application using a **User Assigned Managed Identity** in Azure. You will require this setup if you have `msaAppType: 'UserAssignedMSI'` for the Azure Bot Service (required in dev env generally).

<LanguageInclude section="managed-identity-setup" />

## Missing Service Principal in the Tenant

This error occurs when the application has a single-tenant Azure Bot Service (`msaAppType: 'SingleTenant'`) instance, but your app registration has not yet been linked to a Service Principal in the tenant.

<LanguageInclude section="service-principal-error" />

1. **Sign in to Azure Portal**
   Go to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) and log in with your Azure account.
2. **Navigate to App Registrations**
   In the top search bar, search for **App registrations** and select it.
3. **Search for your application**
   Use the **BOT_ID** from your environment file:
   - Local development → `env/.env.local`
   - Azure deployment → `env/.env.dev`
4. **Check if a Service Principal exists**
   Open the app registration and verify if a Service Principal is created. If it exists already, you should see an entry for a **Managed Application in your local directory** if it exists.

5. **Create a Service Principal if missing**
   If it doesn't exist, click **Create Service Principal** . Wait for the page to finish loading.

6. **Restart your app**
   Once the Service Principal is created, restart your application.
