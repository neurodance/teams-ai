# Code Basics

After following the guidance in [the quickstart](quickstart) to create your first Teams application, let's review its structure and key components. This knowledge can help you build more complex applications as you progress.

## Project Structure

When you create a new Teams application, it generates a directory with this basic structure:

<LanguageInclude section="project-structure" />

<LanguageInclude section="project-structure-description" />

## Core Components

Let's break down the simple application from the [quickstart](quickstart) into its core components.

### The App Class

The heart of an application is the `App` class. This class handles all incoming activities and manages the application's lifecycle. It also acts as a way to host your application service.

<LanguageInclude section="app-class-code" />

The app configuration includes a variety of options that allow you to customize its behavior, including controlling the underlying server, authentication, and other settings.

### Plugins

Plugins are a core part of the Teams SDK. They allow you to hook into various lifecycles of the application. The lifecycles include server events (start, stop, initialize, etc.), and also Teams Activity events <LanguageInclude section="plugin-events" />. In fact, the [DevTools](/developer-tools/devtools) application you already have running is a plugin too. It allows you to inspect and debug your application in real-time.

:::warning
DevTools is a plugin that should only be used in development mode. It should not be used in production applications since it offers no authentication and allows your application to be accessed by anyone.

**Be sure to remove the DevTools plugin from your production code.**

### Message Handling

Teams applications respond to various types of activities. The most basic is handling messages:

<LanguageInclude section="message-handling-code" />

This code:

1. <LanguageInclude section="message-handling-step1" />
2. Sends a typing indicator, which renders as an animated ellipsis (…) in the chat.
3. <LanguageInclude section="message-handling-step3" />

<LanguageInclude section="message-handling-info" />

### Application Lifecycle

Your application starts when you run:

<LanguageInclude section="app-lifecycle-code" />

This code initializes your application server and, when configured for Teams, also authenticates it to be ready for sending and receiving messages.

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basic structure of your Teams application, you're ready to [run it in Teams](running-in-teams). You will learn about Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit and other important tools that help you with deployment and testing your application.

After that, you can:

- Add more activity handlers for different types of interactions. See [Listening to Activities](../essentials/on-activity) for more details.
- Integrate with external services using the [API Client](../essentials/api).
- Add interactive [cards](../in-depth-guides/adaptive-cards) and [dialogs](../in-depth-guides/dialogs).
- Implement [AI](../in-depth-guides/ai).
