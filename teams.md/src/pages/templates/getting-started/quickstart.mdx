# Quickstart

Get started with Teams AI Library (v2) quickly using the Teams CLI.

## Set up a new project

### Prerequisites

<LanguageInclude section="prerequisites" />

## Instructions

### Use the Teams CLI

Use your terminal to run the Teams CLI using npx:

```sh
npx @microsoft/teams.cli --version
```

:::info
_The [Teams CLI](/developer-tools/cli) is a command-line tool that helps you create and manage Teams applications. It provides a set of commands to simplify the development process._<br /><br />
Using `npx` allows you to run the Teams CLI without installing it globally. You can verify it works by running the version command above.
:::

## Creating Your First Agent

Let's begin by creating a simple echo agent that responds to messages. Run:

<LanguageInclude section="create-command" />

This command:

<LanguageInclude section="create-explanation" />

> The `echo` template creates a basic agent that repeats back any message it receives - perfect for learning the fundamentals.

## Running your agent

<LanguageInclude section="running-steps" />

<LanguageInclude section="console-output" />

When the application starts, you'll see:

1. An HTTP server starting up (on port `3978`). This is the main server which handles incoming requests and serves the agent application.
2. A devtools server starting up (on port `3979`). This is a developer server that provides a web interface for debugging and testing your agent quickly, without having to deploy it to Teams.

:::info
The DevTools server runs on a separate port to avoid conflicts with your main application server. This allows you to test your agent locally while keeping the main server available for Teams integration.
:::

Now, navigate to the devtools server by opening your browser and navigating to [http://localhost:3979/devtools](http://localhost:3979/devtools). You should see a simple interface where you can interact with your agent. Try sending it a message!

## Next steps

After creating and running your first agent, read about [the code basics](code-basics) to better understand its components and structure.

Otherwise, if you want to run your agent in Teams, you can check out the [Running in Teams](running-in-teams) guide.
