# Hosting Apps/Static Pages

The `App` class lets you host web apps in the agent. This can be used for an efficient inner loop when building a complex app using Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit, as it lets you build, deploy, and sideload both an agent and a Tab app inside of Teams in a single step. It's also useful in production scenarios, as it makes it straight-forward to host a simple experience such as an agent configuration page or a Dialog.

To host a static tab web app, call the <LanguageInclude section="method-name" /> function and provide an app name and a path to a folder containing an `index.html` file to be served up.

<LanguageInclude section="code-example" />

This registers a route that is hosted at <LanguageInclude section="route-pattern" />.
