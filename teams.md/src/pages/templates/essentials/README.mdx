# Essentials

At its core, an application that hosts an agent on Microsoft Teams exists to do three things well: listen to events, handle the ones that matter, and respond efficiently. Whether a user sends a message, opens a dialog, or clicks a button — your app is there to interpret the event and act on it.

With Teams AI Library v2, we've made it easier than ever to build this kind of reactive, conversational logic. The library introduces a few simple but powerful paradigms to help you connect to Teams, register handlers, and build intelligent agent behaviors quickly.

Before diving in, let's define a few key terms:

<LanguageInclude section="key-terms" />

    AppEventHandlers["<LanguageInclude section="event-handler-label" />"]
    AppRouter["Activity Event Router"]
    AppActivityHandlers["<LanguageInclude section="activity-handler-label" />"]

    Teams --> |Activity| Server
    Teams --> |Signed In| Server
    Teams --> |...other<br/>incoming events| Server
    Server --> |ActivityEvent<br/>or InvokeEvent| AppRouter
    Server ---> |incoming<br/>events| AppEventHandlers
    Server ---> |outgoing<br/>events<br/>| AppEventHandlers
    AppRouter --> |message activity| AppActivityHandlers
    AppRouter --> |card activity| AppActivityHandlers
    AppRouter --> |installation activity| AppActivityHandlers
    AppRouter --> |...other activities| AppActivityHandlers

This section will walk you through the foundational pieces needed to build responsive, intelligent agents using the SDK.
