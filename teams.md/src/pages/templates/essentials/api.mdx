# Teams API Client

Teams has a number of areas that your application has access to via its API. These are all available via the <LanguageInclude section="api-object-name" /> object. Here is a short summary of the different areas:

<LanguageInclude section="api-table" />

An instance of the API client is passed to handlers that can be used to fetch details:

## Example

In this example, we use the API client to fetch the members in a conversation. The <LanguageInclude section="api-object-description" /> object is passed to the activity handler in this case.

<LanguageInclude section="handler-example" />

## Proactive API

It's also possible to access the API client from outside a handler via the app instance. Here we have the same example as above, but we're access the API client via the app instance.

<LanguageInclude section="proactive-example" />
