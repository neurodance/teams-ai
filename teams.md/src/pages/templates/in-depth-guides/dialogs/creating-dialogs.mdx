# Creating Dialogs

:::tip
If you're not familiar with how to build Adaptive Cards, check out [the cards guide](../adaptive-cards). Understanding their basics is a prerequisite for this guide.

### Rendering A Card

You can render an Adaptive Card in a dialog by returning a card response.

<LanguageInclude section="rendering-card-code" />

:::info
The action type for submitting a dialog must be `Action.Submit`. This is a requirement of the Teams client. If you use a different action type, the dialog will not be submitted and the agent will not receive the submission event.

### Rendering A Webpage

You can render a webpage in a dialog as well. There are some security requirements to be aware of:

1. The webpage must be hosted on a domain that is allow-listed as `validDomains` in the Teams app [manifest](/teams/deployment/manifest) for the agent
2. The webpage must also host the [teams-js client library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/teams-js). The reason for this is that for security purposes, the Teams client will not render arbitrary webpages. As such, the webpage must explicitly opt-in to being rendered in the Teams client. Setting up the teams-js client library handles this for you.
