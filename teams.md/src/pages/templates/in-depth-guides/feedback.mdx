# Feedback

User feedback is essential for the improvement of any application. Teams provides specialized UI components to help facilitate the gathering of feedback from users.

## Storage

Once you receive a feedback event, you can choose to store it in some persistent storage. In the example below, we are storing it in an in-memory store.

<LanguageInclude section="storage" />

## Including Feedback Buttons

When sending a message that you want feedback in, simply add feedback functionality to the message you are sending.

<LanguageInclude section="including-feedback" />

## Handling the feedback

Once the user decides to like/dislike the message, you can handle the feedback in a received event. Once received, you can choose to include it in your persistent store.

<LanguageInclude section="handling-feedback" />
