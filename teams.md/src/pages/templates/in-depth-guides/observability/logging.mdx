# 🗃️ Custom Logger

The `App` will provide a default logger, but you can also provide your own.
The default `Logger` instance will be set to <LanguageInclude section="default-logger" /> from the <LanguageInclude section="package-name" /> package.

<LanguageInclude section="custom-logger-example" />
