# 💬 Chat Generation

Before going through this guide, please make sure you have completed the [setup and prerequisites](./setup-and-prereqs.mdx) guide.

# Setup

The basic setup involves creating a `ChatPrompt` and giving it the `Model` you want to use.

        Send --> Prompt
        UserMessage["User Message<br/>Hi how are you?"] --> Send
        Send --> Content["Content<br/>I am doing great! How can I help you?"]

        subgraph Setup
            Messages --> Prompt
            Instructions --> Prompt
            Options["Other options..."] --> Prompt

            Prompt --> Model
        end
    end

    subgraph LLMProvider
        Model --> AOAI["Azure Open AI"]
        Model --> OAI["Open AI"]
        Model --> Anthropic["Claude"]
        Model --> OtherModels["..."]
    end
```

## Simple chat generation

Chat generation is the the most basic way of interacting with an LLM model. It involves setting up your ChatPrompt, the Model, and sending it the message.

## Streaming chat responses

LLMs can take a while to generate a response, so often streaming the response leads to a better, more responsive user experience.

:::warning
Streaming is only currently supported for single 1:1 chats, and not for groups or channels.
