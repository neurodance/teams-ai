## Piping messages to the user

Since your agent is provisioned to work on Teams, one very helpful feature is to use this server as a way to send messages to the user. This can be helpful in various scenarios:

1. Human in the loop - if the server or an MCP client needs to confirm something with the user, it is able to do so.
2. Notifications - the server can be used as a way to send notifications to the user.

Here is an example of how to do this. Configure your plugin so that:

1. It can validate if the incoming request is allowed to send messages to the user
2. It fetches the correct conversation ID for the given user.
3. It sends a proactive message to the user. See [Proactive Messaging](../../../essentials/sending-messages/proactive-messaging) for more details.
