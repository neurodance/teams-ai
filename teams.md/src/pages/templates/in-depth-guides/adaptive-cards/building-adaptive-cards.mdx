# Building Adaptive Cards

Adaptive Cards are JSON payloads that describe rich, interactive UI fragments.

<LanguageInclude section="intro-description" />

## The Builder Pattern

<LanguageInclude section="builder-description" />

Each helper wraps raw JSON and provides fluent, chainable methods that keep your code concise and readable.

<LanguageInclude section="builder-example" />

Benefits:

| Benefit     | Description                                                                   |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Readability | No deep JSON trees—just chain simple methods.                                 |
| Re‑use      | Extract snippets to functions or classes and share across cards.              |
| Safety      | Builders validate every property against the Adaptive Card schema (see next). |

## Type‑safe Authoring & IntelliSense

The package bundles the **Adaptive Card v1.5 schema** as strict <LanguageInclude section="language-name" /> types.
While coding you get:

- **Autocomplete** for every element and attribute.
- **In‑editor validation**—invalid enum values or missing required properties produce build errors.
- Automatic upgrades when the schema evolves; simply update the package.

## The Visual Designer

Prefer a drag‑and‑drop approach? Use [Microsoft's Adaptive Card Designer](https://adaptivecards.microsoft.com/designer.html):

1. Add elements visually until the card looks right.
2. Copy the JSON payload from the editor pane.
3. Paste the JSON into your project **or** convert it to builder calls:

<LanguageInclude section="designer-example" />

This method leverages the full Adaptive Card schema and ensures that the payload adheres strictly to <LanguageInclude section="card-interface" />.

:::tip
You can use a combination of raw JSON and builder helpers depending on whatever you find easier.

### Summary

- Use **builder helpers** for readable, maintainable card code.
- Enjoy **full type safety** and IDE assistance.
- Prototype quickly in the **visual designer** and refine with builders.

Happy card building! 🎉
