- Activity: A special type of Teams-specific event. Activities include things like messages, reactions, and adaptive card actions.
- InvokeActivity: A specific kind of activity triggered by user interaction (like submitting a form), which may or may not require a response.
- Handler: The logic in your application that reacts to events or activities. Handlers decide what to do, when, and how to respond.
