<!-- overview -->

Tab apps will often need to interact with remote services. They may need to fetch data from [Microsoft Graph](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview) or invoke remote agent functions, using the [Nested App Authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/authentication/nested-authentication) (NAA) and the [Microsoft Authentication Library](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/msal-overview) (MSAL) to ensure user consent and to allow the remote service authenticate the user.

The `@microsoft/teams.client` package in this SDK builds on TeamsJS and MSAL to streamline these common scenarios. It aims to simplify:

- **Remote Service Authentication** through MSAL-based authentication and token acquisition.
- **Graph API Integration** by offering a pre-configured and type-safe Microsoft Graph client.
- **Agent Function Calling** by handling authentication and including app context when calling server-side functions implemented Teams SDK agents.
- **Scope Consent Management** by providing simple APIs to test for and request user consent.
